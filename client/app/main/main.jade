          p.client <span>Client:</span> West Australian Cricket Association.
          p HMAS Sydney II departs Fremantle inner harbour.
          p The painting was commissioned by the West Australian Cricket Association (WACA) to form part of their HMAS Sydney II Commemorative Display.
          p This work required a great deal of research to recreate the scene, as accuracy was of the upmost importance for the client. I drilled down into details such as time of day, official weather report, ships alongside, colour schemes of port buildings and even if a woman could have access to North Mole during wartime.
          p The painting was unveiled 11 November 2011 to coincide with the day, 70 years ago, Sydney departed from Gage Roads
